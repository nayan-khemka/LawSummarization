THE PREAH VIHEAR CASE: CAMBODIA v. THAILAND
Matter of conflict between Cambodia & Thailand
The Court had found this claim inadmissible as a new claim, although this is not explicitly stated in the 1962 Judgment.
It settles disputes between the countries in reference with international law and providing opinions on international legal issues arising inter countries.
Cambodian claimed that, as per the map formed by the Mixed Delimitation Commission, set up under the Treaty of 1904, it is evident that the temple falls within the national boundaries of Cambodia and because it distinguishes the frontline between both countries, the temple falls within the sovereignty of Cambodia.
