the aforesaid survey of the material provisions of the act will bring out two or three aspects very clearly.
it is therefore not possible to accept the contention of learned counsel for the respondents that a determination under s 2 4 i of the act to the effect that a particular jagir is a proprietary one necessarily implies that the grantee is entitled to mines and mineral products in the villages comprised in the grant especially when having regard to the definition given in s 2xviii a jagir could be proprietary without a right to mines and mineral products.
the main valid objection to the said inquiry is that the condition precedent the existence of which canlead to the initiation of such inquiry is absent here.
besides while determining the proprietary nature of the grant under s 241 of the act the competent authority had on evidence led before it alluded among others to the respondent 's right to excavate and sell gravel and stones and enjoyment thereof by the respondent.
the appellants seek to challenge the said judgment and order of the gujarat high court in this appeal.
accordingly the high court set aside the collector 's order and further issued an injunction permanently restraining the state of gujarat and the collector from initiating any inquiry under s 372 in respect of the respondents rights to mines and mineral products in the said villages.
he therefore urged that the high court was right in quashing the collector 's order dated february 231973.
ss 5 and 6 make provision as to what persons upon abolition of jagirs and conversion of jagir land into unalienated land would be occupants who shall be primarily liable to the state government for payment of land revenue.
the appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.
